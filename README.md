## Usage

The SCSS files are intended to be copied and used in your own repository so that you can modify the variables and mixins. If you'd like a packaged CSS version checkout the original project: [https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid](https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid).

If you want to create a compile the CSS separate from a project, clone this repository run `npm install` and `npm run build`. Flexbox grid will be compiled to in `src/flex-grid.css`.
